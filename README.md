## Updating Images

There is a (convenient) shell script to update all `Dockerfile` manifests automatically using standard UN*X utilities.

Just execute: `./update.sh` in the project's root, and if there is a new release, `LUME_VERSION` will be updated to that
version accordingly. Commit the changes, create a Pull Request (that will verify images build successfully), and when
merged, another pipeline will take care of building the images (again) and publishing them to Docker Hub.
